	##### HANDELLING MISSING VALUE #####

# MEAN
If data has less outlier

# MEDIAN
If data is skewed distribution than use it only for numerical values

# MODE-highest frequency 
if catgorial data and can be also used for numerical 


	##### DATA VISUALIZATION #####

# MATPLOTLIB PLOTTING STEPS

1)	Importing required libraries and dataset to plot using Pandas pd.read_csv()
2)  Extracting important parts for plots using conditions on Pandas Dataframes.
3)	plt.plot()for plotting line chart similarly in place of plot other functions are used for plotting. All plotting functions require data and it is provided in the function through		parameters.
4)	plot.xlabel , plt.ylabel for labeling x and y-axis respectively.
5)	plt.xticks , plt.yticks for labeling x and y-axis observation tick points respectively.
6)	plt.legend() for signifying the observation variables.
7)	plt.title() for setting the title of the plot.
8)	plot.show() for displaying the plot.

    ##### TYPES OF FEATURES #####
1)  Categorical/Nominal: Variables that can be divided into multiple categories but having no order or priority. 
    Eg. Embarked (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
2)  Binary: A subtype of categorical features, where the variable has only two categories. 
    Eg: Sex (Male/Female)
3)  Ordinal: They are similar to categorical features but they have an order(i.e can be sorted). 
    Eg. Pclass (1, 2, 3)
4)  Continuous: They can take up any value between the minimum and maximum values in a column. 
    Eg. Age, Fare
5)  Count: They represent the count of a variable. 
    Eg. SibSp, Parch
6)  Useless: They donâ€™t contribute to the final outcome of an ML model. 
    Here, PassengerId, Name, Cabin and Ticket might fall into this category.
